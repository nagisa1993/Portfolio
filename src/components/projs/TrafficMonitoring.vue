I developed backend service using Node.js and Express, constructed different database schemas with the utilization of Mongoose. I successfully developed in full-stack for \'Hotspot\', \'History\' and \'Upload\' page. \'Hotspot\' page clearly displays heavy traffic spots in marks and heatmap; \'History\' page can show users\' searching histories; \'Upload\' page can let users upload traffic information around them',
